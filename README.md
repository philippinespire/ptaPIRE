# ptaPIRE
Multispecies analysis of joint site frequency spectra (jSFS) with [PTA](https://github.com/isaacovercast/PTA).

This repo will contain functions for simulating 2D jSFS data (two temporal samples) from populations undergoing recent and ancestral changes in population size, as well as specialized functions for estimating parameters for hierarchical models of size change across species within a community.
